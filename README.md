# SIGASIGABOT

[SIGARETTO](http://sigaretto.org) is a **literary experiment** in nonsensical short stories.
It was authored by three Italian writers from 2014 to early 2017. The project is now closed.

This is a Telegram bot based on my own [template](https://github.com/kolmogorov42/python-telegram-bot-GAE), in turn a fork of @FollonSaxBass's Google App Engine [implementation](https://github.com/FollonSaxBass/python-telegram-bot-GAE).
It aims to provide access to the whole SIGARETTO opus via Telegram inline search, plus a reimplemented SIGARETTO generator feature that replicates the one on the project's website.

More features are on the way, like support for the media accompanying specific SIGARETTOes.

### Usage

Get a Telegram account and invoke
`@SIGASIGABOT <text to search for>`
or 
`@SIGASIGABOT gen`
for a randomly-generated SIGARETTO. Don't press ENTER just yet. Wait until results pop out and click on the one you like.

Text search supports double quotes.
